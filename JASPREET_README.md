# I disabled linting 

## npm
make sure you run npm install as I added some packages
after that, you can run:
npm migrate
npm seed

@Chandni, in production, I know we can set an ENV variable to auto migrate / seed the database upon deployment

## end points

Here are end points

/create/dog
/rentals (to get all rentals)

not sure about I believe Zachary did that one
/gallery/distance/:distance

## 
@Penny, if & when Chandni makes updates to the database, please follow instructions here:
http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/migrations.html

& you can use my existing seeders and modify them accordingly

##
The leave a review button right now is on the dog confirmation handlebars

##
There's a dog.handlebars.backup as there were some changes to that and the one I had and I couldn't figure it out in time
