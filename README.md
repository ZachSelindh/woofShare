## Build Status

This application utilizes Travis CI which automatically builds and tests code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change.

Travis CI clones the repository into a virtual environment, and carries out a series of tasks to build and test code.

If one or more of those tasks fails, the build is considered broken. If none of the tasks fail, the build is considered passed, and Travis CI deploys to the application host.
